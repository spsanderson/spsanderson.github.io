I was looking for a way to democratize the gathering of and visualization of data in both the administrative and clinical sense. This led me to build out `LICHospitalR` a package for my employer that is under active development just like `healthyR`.\n\n`healthyR` can be found [here](https://www.spsanderson.com/healthyR)\n",
