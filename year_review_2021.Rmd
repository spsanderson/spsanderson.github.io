> __2021__ A Year in Review

The year 2021 was a big year for me. I did a lot of coding, a lot more than I 
typically do. The biggest push came personally in my ongoing development of my
R packages that are in the [healthyverse](www.spsanderson.com/healthyverse/). To
use the __healthyverse__ simply do so in the familiar fashion:

```{r install_healthyverse, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("healthyverse")
library(healthyverse)
```

In order to start looking at some of the data that pertains to 2021 lets first
get the data from the CRAN logs. Since I do this daily already, I can simply use
the rds file I already have. I am going to go through the motions though, in case
others might want to do something similar. The functions I am using to get the 
data can [be found here](https://github.com/spsanderson/healthyverse_tsa/blob/master/00_scripts/get_data_functions.R)

Now lets get that data!
```{r get_data, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
source("01_scripts/get_data_functions.R")
source("01_scripts/data_manipulation_functions.R")

get_cran_data()
get_package_release_data()
csv_to_rds()
```

Ok now that we have our data, lets ensure that we are only using the year 2021.
We can do this by filtering out data by time with the [timetk](https://business-science.github.io/timetk/) package. 

Now lets filter our data below, some pre-processing may need to take place.

```{r make_tibble, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(timetk)
data_tbl <- downloads_processed_tbl() %>%
  filter_by_time(
    .date_var = date,
    .start_date = "2021",
    .end_date = "2021"
  )

glimpse(data_tbl)
min(data_tbl$date)
max(data_tbl$date)
```
