Purpose

The beginning of `healthyR` started from an idea that popped into my head while
at work. I was looking for a way to democratize the gathering of and visualization 
of data in both the administrative and clinical sense. This led me to build out
`LICHospitalR` a package for my employer that is under active development just like 
`healthyR`.
