I have worked with David Kun of the ownR platform on a book called [Extending Excel with Python and R](https://packt.link/oTyZJ). With this book you will learn how to eamlessly integrate the Python and R programming languages with spreadsheet-based data analysis to maximize productivity.

# Key Features

*    Perform advanced data analysis and visualization techniques with R and Python on Excel data
*    Use exploratory data analysis and pivot table analysis for deeper insights into your data
*    Integrate R and Python code directly into Excel using VBA or API endpoints
*    Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free PDF eBook

# Book Description

For businesses, data analysis and visualization are crucial for informed decision-making; however, Excel’s limitations can make these tasks time-consuming and challenging. Extending Excel with Python and R is a game changer resource written by experts Steven Sanderson, the author of the healthyverse suite of R packages, and David Kun, co-founder of Functional Analytics, the company behind the ownR platform engineering solution for R, Python, and other data science languages.

This comprehensive guide transforms the way you work with spreadsheet-based data by integrating Python and R with Excel to automate tasks, execute statistical analysis, and create powerful visualizations. Working through the chapters, you’ll find out how to perform exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, and even integrate APIs for maximum efficiency. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, this book has everything you need to unlock Excel's full potential and take your data analysis skills to the next level.

By the end of this book, you’ll be able to import data from Excel, manipulate it in R or Python, and perform the data analysis tasks in your preferred framework while pushing the results back to Excel for sharing with others as needed.
