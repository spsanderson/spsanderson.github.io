Hello! I'm Steven Paul Sanderson II, MPH, a professional with a Master of Public Health degree, specializing in areas related to health information systems management and data science. I work as a Manager of Applications at Stony Brook Medicine in the Patient Accounts Department. In this role, I oversees the implementation and management of software applications that support the department's operations and patient accounts management.

In addition to my professional responsibilities, I am an active developer in the R programming community. I maintain several R packages, including: `healthyR`, `healthyR.ts`, `healthyR.ai`, `healthyR.data`, `TidyDensity`, `tidyAML` and `healthyverse`.

These packages are geared towards data analysis, time series forecasting, artificial intelligence applications, data management, density estimation, and automated machine learning, reflecting his expertise in coding and data science.

I am also passionate about continuous learning and professional development, with goals to pursue an additional master's degrees in health information systems management. My interests span computers, coding, movies, and music.
